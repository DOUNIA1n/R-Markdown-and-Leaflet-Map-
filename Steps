### Step 1: Write the code

### Step 2: Render Your R Markdown Document

Open your R Markdown file in RStudio and click the "Knit" button to render the document to HTML.

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**

   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.

2. **Add Your Files to the Repository:**

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**

   - Go to the repository's **Settings**.
   - Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch where you uploaded the HTML file (e.g., `main` or `master`).
   - Save the changes. GitHub will provide a URL where your page will be hosted.

### Step 4: Verify Your Web Page

Check the GitHub Pages URL provided in the settings. Ensure the page displays the date and the Leaflet map as expected.

### Step 5: Verify Rubric Requirements

1. **Date Check:**
   - Ensure the date in the R Markdown file (`date: "`r Sys.Date()`"`) is current and less than two months before todayâ€™s date.

2. **Map Check:**
   - Confirm the map is interactive and has been created using Leaflet.



By following these steps, you should have a web page featuring a date and an interactive Leaflet map, hosted on GitHub Pages. Feel free to get creative with additional features or map customizations!
